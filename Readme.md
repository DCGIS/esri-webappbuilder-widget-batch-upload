**Esri Web AppBuilder Batch Upload Widget**

The purpose of the batch upload widget is to give the user the ability to add a batch of address point features. This benefits the user by saving time rather than placing each point individually.

Currently supported upload formats include:
* CSV
* GeoJSON
* Zipped Shapefile
* GPX

After a user chooses the upload file, a field mapping table will appear near the bottom of the widget.  This will allow users to map fields from their input dataset to the database fields.
