**Esri Web AppBuilder Batch Upload Widget**

The purpose of the batch upload widget is to give the user the ability to add a batch of address point features. This benefits the user by saving time rather than placing each point individually.

Currently supported upload formats include:
* CSV
* GeoJSON
* Zipped Shapefile
* GPX

After a user chooses the upload file, a field mapping table will appear near the bottom of the widget.  This will allow users to map fields from their input dataset to the database fields.

Before getting started extending this widget, please review the Esri documentation at: [https://github.com/Esri/generator-esri-appbuilder-js](https://github.com/Esri/generator-esri-appbuilder-js)
